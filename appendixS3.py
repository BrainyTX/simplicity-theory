# S3-0: SETUP & GEOMETRIC CONSTANTS
# ==============================================================================
# This script provides a self-consistent, symbolic derivation for the dynamics
# of the FCC medium, correcting the circularity and scaling issues identified
# in previous versions. All dynamical properties are derived from the fixed
# geometry established in S1 and S2.

# R: Radius of the sphere
# a: Lattice constant of the FCC unit cell
# rho_star: The intrinsic, fundamental energy density of the medium.
# This remains as the single, fundamental scaling factor of the theory,
# to be calibrated once against an experimental value (e.g., electron mass).
R, a, rho_star = sp.symbols('R a rho_star', positive=True)

# From the proof in S1, the stable geometry is 50% interpenetration.
# This geometrically locks the relationship between the radius R and the lattice constant a.
# R = a / sqrt(2)
geometry_relation = sp.Eq(R, a / sp.sqrt(2))
